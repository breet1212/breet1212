Combos
Dark C + Dagger X + Dagger Z + Superhuman C + Flash Step + Superhuman X + Dark X + Superhuman Z
Dark X/C + Dagger X + Superhuman Z + Dagger Z + Superhuman C + Flash Step + Superhuman X (one shot for same bounty buffs)
If you use Kilo's X and then use Dark Dagger's Z you can launch the boss/entity/player REALLY far away, meaning it is good to use to escape PVP. Same with Dark dagger Z + Superhuman C.
Abyssal Darkness (until enemy is close to you) + Intense Wind + Shaming Slash + Proficient Impale + Conqueror Gun. A simple combo that makes an enemy's health 1/4 (with Valkyrie Helmet equipped).
Dark v2 X + Acidum Rifle Z/Kabucha X (do this very quickly) + Dark Dagger X + Superhuman Z + Dark Dagger Z + Flash Step near the enemy + Superhuman X. If the opponent is still alive, try to run away and hit them Superhuman C.
Dark awakened X or C + Kabucha X + Dark Dagger X + Dark Dagger Z + Superhuman Z + Superhuman C + Flash Step + Superhuman X (sounds illegal but you can do it if your enemy is lagging and did it really fast)
Revive Z/Revive X + Dark Dagger Z + Dark Dagger X + Superhuman Z + Superhuman C + Soru + Superhuman X Cre: JCWK (a 100k subs bounty hunting youtuber)
Dark X + Kabucha X + Superhuman C + Dark Dagger X + Dark Dagger Z + Dark F + Dark C + Superhuman Z + Flash Step + Superhuman X (1 shot if enemy not max defense)
Dark X or C + Dragon Talon X + Dark Dagger Z + M1 (very low chance hitting) + Dark Dagger X + Dragon Talon Z + Soru + Dragon Talon C
Dark X or C + Sharkman Karate Z + Kabucha X + Dark Dagger Z + X + Sharkman Karate X + C
Ice V + Electric Claw Z X C (Thunder Clap And Flash is hard to hit) (Look UP) Dark Dagger Z X (idk if x will hit but this is homemade combo)
Dark V + Kabucha x + Dark Dagger x + Electric claw x + Electric claw c + (look up) dark dagger z
Kabucha X > Dark Dagger Z > Dark V2 X > Dark Dagger X > Dragon Talon X > Dragon Talon Z
